[2024-08-03 21:13] Tessa: Did you sleep at all last night?
[2024-08-03 21:15] Hardin: Couldn't sleep. My head’s a mess.
[2024-08-04 09:08] Tessa: I can't stop thinking about our fight.
[2024-08-04 09:11] Hardin: I never meant to hurt you.
[2024-08-05 17:42] Tessa: You're impossible sometimes, you know that?
[2024-08-05 17:44] Hardin: I’m not good at this—at feelings.
[2024-08-06 13:00] Tessa: I miss how things used to be.
[2024-08-06 13:04] Hardin: Every song reminds me of you lately.
[2024-08-07 22:20] Tessa: Let's not ruin what we have over one bad day.
[2024-08-07 22:23] Hardin: Don’t give up on me. Not yet.
[2024-08-08 08:56] Tessa: I saw your favorite book today. Thought of you.
[2024-08-08 08:58] Hardin: I miss your laugh. Even the annoying one.
[2024-08-09 16:35] Tessa: You're so stubborn. But I still care.
[2024-08-09 16:36] Hardin: I saw you across campus today. You looked happy. I hated it.
[2024-08-10 19:11] Tessa: Can we just have one normal day?
[2024-08-10 19:14] Hardin: I wish I could fix everything I broke.
[2024-08-11 14:26] Tessa: You're the most confusing person I've ever met.
[2024-08-11 14:30] Hardin: You deserve someone better than me.
[2024-08-12 10:22] Tessa: You drive me crazy… in every way.
[2024-08-12 10:23] Hardin: But I still want to be that someone.
[2024-08-13 21:47] Tessa: I still remember the first time we kissed.
[2024-08-13 21:48] Hardin: Tell me how to make this right.
[2024-08-14 07:50] Tessa: Promise me you won't disappear again.
[2024-08-14 07:52] Hardin: It hurts pretending I don’t care.
[2024-08-15 18:10] Tessa: Why do you always shut down when things get real?
[2024-08-15 18:12] Hardin: You were the best thing that ever happened to me.
[2024-08-16 11:31] Tessa: I hate that I love you this much.
[2024-08-16 11:33] Hardin: I know I messed up, but I’m trying.
[2024-08-17 20:45] Tessa: Maybe we just need a break.
[2024-08-17 20:46] Hardin: Can we start over? Just once?
[2024-08-18 14:05] Tessa: I'm scared to lose you again.
[2024-08-18 14:07] Hardin: Do you still wear that hoodie I left?
[2024-08-19 09:10] Tessa: Everything reminds me of you.
[2024-08-19 09:14] Hardin: Sometimes I type a message and never hit send.
[2024-08-20 13:18] Tessa: Do you ever regret us?
[2024-08-20 13:20] Hardin: You're always in my head. Always.
[2024-08-21 22:00] Tessa: You were right. I needed time.
[2024-08-21 22:03] Hardin: I didn’t mean what I said. I was angry.
[2024-08-22 08:45] Tessa: Come over. Let’s talk. No fighting.
[2024-08-22 08:46] Hardin: I love you. Even when I can't say it right.
[2024-08-23 12:17] Tessa: I’m not asking you to be perfect. Just to show up.
[2024-08-23 12:20] Hardin: I show up. Just never in the way you need me to.
[2024-08-24 10:06] Tessa: You don’t even realize how much I hold back for you.
[2024-08-24 10:08] Hardin: And I’d destroy the world for you. We both give, differently.
[2024-08-25 17:33] Tessa: You looked distant at lunch today.
[2024-08-25 17:35] Hardin: I was scared you were slipping away again.
[2024-08-26 09:50] Tessa: I’m not going anywhere. But I need honesty.
[2024-08-26 09:52] Hardin: No more hiding. I promise.
[2024-08-27 19:12] Tessa: What are we even doing anymore?
[2024-08-27 19:14] Hardin: Living between chaos and hope.
[2024-08-28 14:48] Tessa: Some days I don’t recognize us.
[2024-08-28 14:50] Hardin: Some days, neither do I. But I still feel you in everything.
[2024-08-29 20:00] Tessa: I re-read your old texts. Why did you stop writing like that?
[2024-08-29 20:03] Hardin: I never stopped feeling it. Just didn’t know how to say it anymore.
[2024-08-30 07:35] Tessa: You hurt me less with silence than with your temper.
[2024-08-30 07:36] Hardin: I’m working on it. Rage doesn’t get to speak for me anymore.
[2024-08-31 16:21] Tessa: Let’s not waste another month pretending we’re okay.
[2024-08-31 16:23] Hardin: Then let’s rebuild it. Not fake it.
[2024-09-01 18:19] Tessa: I love who you are becoming.
[2024-09-01 18:20] Hardin: That version is because of you.
[2024-09-02 13:10] Tessa: You didn’t say goodnight last night.
[2024-09-02 13:12] Hardin: Fell asleep reading your old letters. You were all over my dreams.
[2024-09-03 10:00] Tessa: I made coffee. Your mug’s on the counter.
[2024-09-03 10:01] Hardin: With the little fox on it? You really want me to
[2024-08-23 19:01] Tessa: I passed the exam. Barely.
[2024-08-23 19:03] Hardin: That’s my girl. Even when you doubt yourself, you win.
[2024-08-24 10:12] Tessa: I didn’t feel like a winner.
[2024-08-24 10:14] Hardin: You don’t see what I see when I look at you.
[2024-08-25 16:28] Tessa: We should celebrate. Just us.
[2024-08-25 16:30] Hardin: I’ll bring wine. You bring that smirk.
[2024-08-26 22:00] Tessa: You were quiet tonight. Something on your mind?
[2024-08-26 22:03] Hardin: Just thinking about everything I could lose if I screw this up.
[2024-08-27 08:50] Tessa: That’s the thing. You think you’ll screw it up before we even try.
[2024-08-27 08:52] Hardin: Old habits. Hard to kill.
[2024-08-28 14:10] Tessa: I had a dream you moved away. I woke up crying.
[2024-08-28 14:13] Hardin: I’m not going anywhere. Not without you.
[2024-08-29 18:20] Tessa: You say the most dangerous things at the perfect times.
[2024-08-29 18:22] Hardin: Because I mean them. Every one.
[2024-08-30 07:40] Tessa: My mom wants to meet you again.
[2024-08-30 07:44] Hardin: She still think I’m a walking red flag?
[2024-08-30 07:45] Tessa: Yes. But she also said I smile more since I met you.
[2024-08-31 13:50] Hardin: Then maybe I’m not a complete disaster.
[2024-08-31 13:53] Tessa: No, just slightly cracked porcelain.
[2024-09-01 09:11] Hardin: I’d break a thousand times if it meant I get to heal with you.
[2024-09-01 09:14] Tessa: How do you still say things that ruin me inside?
[2024-09-02 17:28] Tessa: Do you remember our first night together?
[2024-09-02 17:30] Hardin: I remember the light in your eyes more than anything.
[2024-09-03 21:08] Tessa: I was scared. But you made it feel safe.
[2024-09-03 21:10] Hardin: I was terrified too. Of how much I felt.
[2024-09-04 11:00] Tessa: I think I’m falling again.
[2024-09-04 11:03] Hardin: Then let’s fall. Together this time.
[2024-09-05 15:20] Tessa: Sometimes I still wait for you to push me away.
[2024-09-05 15:22] Hardin: I’ve done enough pushing. I want to pull you closer now.
[2024-09-06 07:30] Tessa: I love the way your voice cracks when you're emotional.
[2024-09-06 07:32] Hardin: It only cracks for you.
[2024-09-07 19:12] Tessa: What if we don’t make it?
[2024-09-07 19:15] Hardin: Then we’ll rebuild it until we do.
[2024-09-08 10:50] Tessa: You always have an answer.
[2024-09-08 10:51] Hardin: I only have answers when the question is you.
[2024-09-09 14:17] Tessa: I’m going to London over break.
[2024-09-09 14:20] Hardin: Without me?
[2024-09-10 09:05] Tessa: It’s just for a week. I need space to think.
[2024-09-10 09:07] Hardin: I hate how much that hurts to read.
[2024-09-11 16:44] Tessa: It’s not the end.
[2024-09-11 16:45] Hardin: But it feels like a pause I didn’t ask for.
[2024-09-12 08:12] Tessa: I landed. It’s raining here. Feels like you.
[2024-09-12 08:14] Hardin: Moody, unpredictable, and hard to love?
[2024-09-12 08:15] Tessa: Familiar, deep, and a little stormy.
[2024-09-13 19:30] Hardin: My bed feels too big without you.
[2024-09-13 19:31] Tessa: My heart feels too small for all these feelings.
[2024-09-14 12:00] Hardin: I’m writing again. Mostly about you.
[2024-09-14 12:03] Tessa: Can I read it?
[2024-09-14 12:05] Hardin: One day. When you’re ready to hear the truth under the pain.
[2024-09-15 07:56] Tessa: I saw a couple kiss on the bridge. I felt hollow.
[2024-09-15 07:58] Hardin: Come home. I’ll fill the hollow with new memories.
[2024-09-16 22:18] Tessa: Not yet. I’m still sorting my heart out.
[2024-09-16 22:21] Hardin: Take your time. I’ll be here. Always.
[2024-09-17 10:30] Tessa: I watched our favorite movie last night. Alone.
[2024-09-17 10:32] Hardin: I watched the credits of your absence.
[2024-09-18 17:11] Tessa: That was almost poetic.
[2024-09-18 17:14] Hardin: I only speak in poetry when it’s about you.
[2024-09-19 13:50] Tessa: Remember when you said we were a storm?
[2024-09-19 13:52] Hardin: Yeah. You were the thunder. I was the lightning.
[2024-09-19 13:53] Tessa: I think we forgot we were also the sky holding it together.
[2024-09-20 18:05] Hardin: That’s beautiful. You always were the better writer.
[2024-09-21 11:40] Tessa: I come home tomorrow. My flight's at 8pm.
[2024-09-21 11:41] Hardin: I’ll be there. Terminal 2. Black hoodie. Broken heart.
[2024-09-22 20:09] Tessa: I see you.
[2024-09-22 20:10] Hardin: I see you. God, I missed that face.
[2024-09-23 01:12] Tessa: Holding you again felt like breathing for the first time in weeks.
[2024-09-23 01:14] Hardin: Holding you felt like forgiveness.
[2024-09-24 16:45] Tessa: What now?
[2024-09-24 16:46] Hardin: We start over. But we remember everything.
[2024-09-25 07:30] Tessa: Can we really do this again?
[2024-09-25 07:32] Hardin: We never really stopped.
[2024-09-26 09:11] Tessa: I told my mom we're trying again.
[2024-09-26 09:14] Hardin: Did she threaten me?
[2024-09-26 09:15] Tessa: She said, “Don’t waste her heart this time.”
[2024-09-27 22:30] Hardin: Then I won’t. I swear.
[2024-09-28 12:00] Tessa: I believe you. For the first time in forever.
[2024-09-29 19:05] Hardin: That means more than you know.
[2024-09-30 08:45] Tessa: I want to try again. All the way.
[2024-09-30 08:47] Hardin: Then we’re all in. No halfway love.
